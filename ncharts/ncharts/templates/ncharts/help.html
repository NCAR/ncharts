<h4>Bugs and Idiosyncracies</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Response will be slow if you ask for a large quantity of data. Data reduction and compression are not supported.</li>
    <li>Plots do not appear on the stock Android browser on phones. Use Chrome instead.</li>
    <li>On phones, to scroll up or down , try swiping on the right-hand side to activate a small scrollbar.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Other Help</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1-D Time Series Traces</li>
    <ul>
        <li>All selected variables with the same units will be plotted together.</li>
        <li>Click on the variable name at the bottom of a plot to toggle the visibility of the trace, and dynamically rescale the remaining traces.</li>
        <li>Use the sliders on the "navigator" trace below the chart to zoom in, and drag the selection to pan back and forth in time</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Time X Height Plots (Currently only 449 profiler data from DEEPWAVE)</li>
    <ul>
        <li>For time X height plots, drag a rectangle across the plot to zoom in time.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
