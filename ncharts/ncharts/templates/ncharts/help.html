NCharts is intended to be a quick-look display of a wide variety of data, not a tool for detailed analysis. The plot options will be limited to keep things simple and useable across a variety of display sizes.

NCharts uses the Highcharts.com javascript plotting library which provides some nice interactive capabilities for zooming and displaying point values.

<h4>Time Series</h4>
<ul>
    <li>General Information</li>
    <ul>
        <li>When a time zone is selected, the start time will be adjusted to indicate the same moment in time. The time labels on the plot will be in the selected time zone.</li>
        <li>After changing a selection of variables, time or time zone, hit Plot to update the plot, as it is not automatically updated when a selection is made.</li>
        <li>Check "Track Real Time" to poll the server for real-time updates.</li>
        <li>To plot more than one dataset, open separate browser windows or tabs.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>1-D Time Series Traces</li>
    <ul>
        <li>All selected variables with the same units will be plotted together.</li>
        <li>The sequence of plots is alphabetical by the name of the first variable in the plot.</li>
        <li>For all variables with the same units, the sequence in the legend will be alphabetical, by name.</li>
        <li>Click on a variable name in the legend at the bottom of a plot to toggle the visibility of the trace, and dynamically rescale the remaining traces.</li>
        <li>Use the sliders on the "navigator" trace below the chart to zoom in, and drag the selection to pan back and forth in time</li>
    </ul>

    <li>Time vs Height Plots (Currently only 449 profiler)</li>
    <ul>
        <li>The plots will be in alphabetical order, by variable name.</li>
        <li>To zoom in time and height, drag a rectangle across the plot. A <b>Reset zoom</b> button will appear in the top right to zoom back out.</li>
        <li>The Y axis is the height index of the observations. Click on the (otherwise boring) height plot to see the height in meters at an index.</li>
    </ul>

</ul>

<h4>Sounding Profiles</h4>
  <ul>
      <li>When a start time and time length are selected, the available soundings for that period are shown  by their launch time in UTC.</li>
      <li>Choose one or more soundings, one or more X axis variables and a Y axis variable, typically <b>alt</b> or <b>gpsalt</b>.  A profile will be plotted for each sounding selected.</li>
      <li>Currently 1000 points are plotted for each sounding.</li>
      <li>If the sonde reverses vertical direction, those points will not be shown.<li>
      <li>Click on a variable name in the legend at the bottom of a plot to toggle the visibility of the trace, and dynamically rescale the remaining traces.</li>
      <li>To zoom in X and Y, drag a rectangle on the plot with your mouse. A <b>Reset zoom</b> button will appear in the top right to zoom back out.</li>
  </ul>

<h4>Real-time Updates</h4>
<ul>
    <li>To plot data as they arrive in near real-time, check the "Track Real Time" box, and select a time length for the plot. You do not need to enter a start time.</li>
    <li>This option is only enabled for projects that are on-going.</li>
    <li>Your browser will poll the server for new data, at a time interval equal to 1/2 the average delta-T of the data. The plot will scroll and and start time will be updated when new data arrives.</li>
    <li>Real-time updates will fill in missing data for each variable back to the time of the previous non-missing value. If values previous to that time were updated by data processing, they will not be updated in the Ncharts display. Click on the Plot button to do a complete refresh.</li>
    <li>Real-time updates are currently not supported for soundings.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Bugs and Idiosyncracies</h4>
<ul>
    <li>This software is in development, and the server may be restarted quite frequently, which can cause real-time-updates to cease on your browser. If your plot is unresponsive, do a page reload, for which F5 is a common shortcut. If that does not help, click on the "NCharts" link at the top of the page, and then re-select your project and dataset.</li>
    <li>Response will be slow if you ask for a large quantity of data. Data reduction and compression are not supported.</li>
    <li>Plots do not appear on the stock Android browser on phones. Use Chrome instead.</li>
    <li>On phones, to scroll up or down , try swiping on the right-hand side to activate a small scrollbar.</li>
    <li>Clicking Today in the datetime widget will set the time and date to the current time, in the browser's local time zone. It will then be interpreted in the selected time zone.</li>
    <li>If you return to plot a previous dataset, you may have to do a browser refresh to see the variables and time you selected previously.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Printing</h4>
<ul>
    <li>The "hamburger" icon at the top right of each plot is a print menu.<li>
    <li>Select <b>Print chart</b> to print on your local system, which may give you the option to a PDF or PNG file.</li>
    <li>If you select one of the <b>Download</b> options, the plot will be sent to a Highcharts server for rendering and then made available for download. If the Highcharts servers are overloaded, a blank screen may result, in which case, try again later.</li>
</ul>
