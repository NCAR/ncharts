# ncharts

Data plotting Web application, developed at NCAR EOL.

See `README-devel.md` for information on setting up a development server.

Once you are familiar with the setting up a development server, the steps for setting up a production server are quite similiar.  See `README-prod.md` for information on setting up an NCharts production server using the Apache web server.
